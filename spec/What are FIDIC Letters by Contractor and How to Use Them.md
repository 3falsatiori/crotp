# What are FIDIC Letters by Contractor and How to Use Them?
 
FIDIC is an acronym for the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, which is a global organization that provides standard forms of contract for various types of engineering and construction projects. One of these forms is the FIDIC Conditions of Contract for Works of Civil Engineering Construction, 4th Ed, 1987 (Red Book, 4th Ed), which is widely used for civil works contracts.

One of the features of the Red Book is that it contains a set of standard letters and notices that can be used by the contractor to communicate with the employer and the engineer on various aspects of the contract. These letters and notices cover topics such as:
 
- Assignment by the employer
- Delegation of powers by the engineer
- Subcontracting
- Clarification of ambiguities or discrepancies in the contract documents
- Request for additional information or drawings
- Notice of delay or disruption
- Submission of design work for approval
- Performance security
- Physical obstructions or conditions on site
- Legally or physically impossible work
- Submission of program and cash flow estimate
- Setting out data and exploratory works
- Insurance
- Fossils, geological or archaeological interest
- Claims for additional costs and extension of time
- Patent rights
- Damage to roads or bridges on the route to site
- Payment for services provided
- Return of labor and contractor's equipment
- Samples and tests
- Examination of work before covering up
- Removal of improper work
- Suspension of work
- Taking-over certificate
- Maintenance period and defects liability
- Variations and adjustments
- Certificates and payments
- Determination of contract
- Disputes and arbitration

The standard letters and notices are intended to facilitate the administration of the contract and to ensure that the parties comply with their contractual obligations. They also serve as a record of the communications between the parties and can be used as evidence in case of disputes or claims.
  
The contractor can use the standard letters and notices as templates or modify them as necessary to suit the specific circumstances of each case. However, the contractor should always follow the relevant contract clauses and instructions from the engineer when writing or sending any letter or notice. The contractor should also keep copies of all letters and notices sent or received for future reference.
  
The standard letters and notices are available in PDF format from the FIDIC website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^]. The contractor can download them and print them out or use them electronically. The contractor should also check if there are any local laws or regulations that may affect the use or validity of these letters and notices.
